        <h1>ENGINEERING CAREERS AND THE EDUCATION YOU'LL NEED</h1>
        <p>If you think you'd like to enter the engineering field but don't know what to do next, read on for a step-by-step guide.</p>
        <h1>What is an engineer?</h1>
        <p>Engineering is the art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, experience, judgment, and common sense to
        make things that benefit people. Engineers design bridges and important medical equipment as well as processes for
        cleaning up toxic spills and systems for mass transit. Engineering is the process of producing a technical product or
        system to meet a specific need.</p>
        <h1>What types of engineers are there?</h1>
        <p>The five largest engineering areas are:</p>
        <p>Chemical engineering</p>
        <p>Civil engineering</p>
        <p>Electrical engineering</p>
        <p>Industrial engineering</p>
        <p>Mechanical engineering</p>
        <p>Computer engineering</p>
        <h1>What qualities do successful engineers have?</h1>
        <p>Strong in mathematics and science</p>
        <p>Highly analytical and detail-oriented</p>
        <p>Imaginative and creative</p>
        <p>Good communication skills</p>
        <p>Enjoy working in teams</p>
        <p>Enjoy building or improving the way things work</p>
        <h1>Should I earn a master's or doctorate engineering degree?</h1>
        <p>This depends on your career goals and what area of engineering you'd like to practice:</p>
        <p>Master's programs are designed to expand and deepen the knowledge and skills acquired as an undergraduate. Master's
        degree programs in engineering require two years of full-time graduate study.</p>
        <p>Doctoral programs require five-to-seven years of graduate study, while PhD programs are generally designed for people
        primarily interested in research and education in the engineering field.</p>
